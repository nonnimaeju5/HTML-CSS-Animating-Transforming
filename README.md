# In this project i used a tutorial from LearnDesign and created an animated landing page about a photography gallery using only html and css(css rotate, css keyframe animation).

## I tried to do this pretty simple as i am am using animation for the first time.

## The main class is wrapper. The header has been taken inside it, in which I have added the left side logo and the right side menu has been added. I added Home, About, Skills, Portfolio, Review, Contact in the menu. 

## Next up i created a section called home common and Iâ€™ve taken another div and named its shape. Inside that, I have taken a div named text and a div named img. 

## in CSS, I used the animation keyframes property of CSS3 for animation. Transform Rotate is used to rotate the shape 360 degrees and Transform Translate is used to move the shape. 

## In this project, I have used CSS properties like CSS transform rotate, CSS transform translation, CSS keyframe animation# HTML-CSS-Animating-Transforming
